[+]Python - if/else, loops, functions
[+].......In Python, there are several constructs that allow for more complex control flow and code organization: if/else statements, loops, and functions.[+]

[+] If/else statements:
    	    If/else statements in Python allow for conditional execution of code. The basic syntax of an if/else statem		   ent in Python is:
	    if condition:
	        # code to execute if condition is true
		else:
		    # code to execute if condition is false

	  [+] Here, condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (True or False). If condition is True,		[+]then the code within the if block will be executed. If condition is False, then the code within the else block will be executed.
Loops
Loops allow for repetitive execution of code. In Python, there are two types of loops: for loops and while loops.
