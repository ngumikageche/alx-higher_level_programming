Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for a variety of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, and since then it has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Python is known for its clear, concise syntax and its ease of use. It is an object-oriented language, which means that it provides features for working with objects and classes, and it also supports functional programming concepts. Python has a large standard library and an active community of developers who contribute to third-party packages that can be easily installed using package managers like pip.
